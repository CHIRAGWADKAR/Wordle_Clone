## Wordle Clone using Python
Wordle is an interesting word game available on the official website of [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).
This repository contains the code for the clone I have created of Wordle.
The code base is totally in python and the module used in creating this clone of Wordle is pygame.
Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games.

## How to Play
You just need to download main.py file into your local machine and run it.

## Rules 
1. You are given 5 blank boxes and 6 chances to make a guess about a word with five letters and fill those five boxes with letters forming a meaningful word.
2. The words not having a meaning are not accepted.
3. If the word you guessed is totally right, you win the game.
4. If a letter from your guessed word is not present in the word then the colour of the box will be Black.
5. If a letter is present in the word but not at the correct position then the colour of the box will be Yellow.
6. If a letter is present in the word and is in the correct place then the colour of the box will be Green.
7. If all the the boxes are green, it means that you won the game.
8. If you are not able to guess the word even after 6 tries, the word is displayed on the screen.

So let's start the game and make a guess!
